## Botpress Question Answering

This module goal is to allow botpress to reply questions from textual documents in an unsupervised way.

At the end we should be able to give it a website Url, pdfs or differents documents and it will act like a custom search engine

It is written in python and will run in a docker which will then be integrated with a module calling the api
